Why Backup Kubernetes ?
To Recover from Disasters such as
Someone accidentally deleted a namespace
Kubernetes API upgrade failed and you need to revert back
Network went down.
Cluster goes into an unrecoverable state
Latest application push introduced a critical bug that wiped a persistent volume and you lost the data.
Rare case of a natural disaster making your cluster inaccessible.
2. Replicate the environment for debugging, development , staging or before a major upgrade.
3. Migration of Kubernetes cluster from one environment to another.


What to Backup ?
We’ve looked at the Why, now comes the next question of What.
Two things you need to backup :
Kubernetes stores its state in etcd , so to restore the master, etcd and relevant
certificates must be backed up. This post wont talk about about backing up etcd as
its quite well documented here
Application data i.e persistent volumes, because lets face it you will be having
stateful applications running on your cluster. We cover this point in this post.
