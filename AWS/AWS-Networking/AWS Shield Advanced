 AWS WAF web access control lists (web ACLs) helps  minimize the effects of a distributed
denial of service (DDoS) attack.
For additional protection against DDoS attacks, AWS also provides AWS
Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced. AWS Shield Standard is automatically included at no extra
cost beyond what you already pay for AWS WAF and your other AWS services.

AWS Shield Advanced
provides expanded DDoS attack protection for your Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load
balancers, CloudFront distributions, Route 53 hosted zones, and AWS Global Accelerator accelerators.
AWS Shield Advanced incurs additional charges.
