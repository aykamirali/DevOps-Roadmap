A normal pipeline job is meant for building a single branch from the SCM and deploy to a single environment.

A multibranch pipeline is meant for building multiple branches from a repository and deploy to multiple environments if required.

A pipeline job supports both pipeline steps to be added in Jenkins configuration and form SCM.


Use pipeline job for adhoc jobs, parameterised job executions and to debug pipeline as code.

Do not use multibranch pipeline if you do not have a standard branching and CI/CD strategy.
