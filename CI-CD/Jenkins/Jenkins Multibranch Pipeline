A multi-branch pipeline is a concept of automatically creating Jenkins pipelines based on Git branches.

Meaning, it can automatically discover new branches in the source control (Github) and automatically
creates a pipeline for that branch.

When the pipeline build starts, Jenkins uses the Jenkinsfile in that branch for build stages.

Multi-branch pipeline supports PR based branch discovery.

Meaning, branches get discovered automatically in the pipeline if someone raises a
PR (pull request) from a branch. If you have this configuration enabled, builds
will get triggered only if a PR is raised.

You can add conditional logic to the Jenkinsfile to build jobs based on the branch requirement.


For example, if you want the feature branch to run only unit testing and sonar
analysis, you can have a condition to skip the deployment stage with a when
condition as shown below.
