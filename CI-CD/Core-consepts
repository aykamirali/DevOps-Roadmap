Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their
code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.


Continuous deployment/delivery (CD) is a software development practice where code changes are
automatically built, tested, and prepared for production release. It expands on continuous integration
by deploying all code changes to a testing environment, a production environment, or both after the
build stage has been completed. Continuous delivery can be fully automated with a workflow process or
partially automated with manual steps at critical points.
