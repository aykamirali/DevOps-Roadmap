How to provide access to other users and roles after cluster creation ?

For example if we create EKS with Jenkins server how to access cluster other users ?

Initially, only the creator of the Amazon EKS cluster has system:masters permissions
to configure the cluster. To extend system:masters permissions to other users and roles,
you must add the aws-auth ConfigMap to the configuration of the Amazon EKS cluster.
The ConfigMap allows other IAM entities, such as users and roles,
to access the Amazon EKS cluster.
