1. When a developer creates a PR from a feature branch to
   develop a branch, Github sends a webhook with the  PR information to Jenkins.

2. Jenkins receives the PR and finds the relevant multibranch pipeline and
   creates a feature branch pipeline automatically.

3. It then runs the jobs with the steps mentioned in the Jenkinsfile from the feature branch.

4. During checkout, the source and target branches in the PR gets merged.
   The PR merge will be blocked on Github until a build status from Jenkins is returned.

5. Once the build finishes, Jenkins will update the status to Github PR.
   Now you will be able to merge the code.
