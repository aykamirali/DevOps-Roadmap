A Secret is a resource that helps cluster operators manage the deployment of
sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys.

These Secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables
to the containers in a Kubernetes Pod, thus decoupling Pod deployment from managing
sensitive data needed by the containerized applications within a Pod.

The challenge here is with integrating these Secrets into the GitOps workflow by
storing the relevant YAML manifests outside the cluster, in a Git repository.
The data in a Secret is obfuscated by using merely Base64 encoding. Storing such
files in a Git repository is extremely insecure as it is trivial to decode the
Base64-encoded data. Often developers accidentally check these files into their
Git repositories, thus exposing sensitive information—such as credentials—to their
production databases.
